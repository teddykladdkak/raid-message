# raid-message
## What is this!
This project aims to replace Facebook, Messenger, Discord, etc. in the pursuit of the next Raid in Pok√©mon Go. It is currently at the earliest stage of development.

## Config
At the moment, it is very fine-tuned to work in the Lund area, but not a lot of configuration is required to enable you to start your own server for your city.

## Todo
* ~~Change order of comments.~~
* Add time when comment is made.
* Clean "raids.json" at the days end.
* Enlarge buttons and inputs.
* Allows users to see who said they are coming.
* Ability to edit post and time.
* Users should be able to delete their own posts.
* ~~Give the user information if no raids are posted (instead of a blank page).~~
* Script for image to text (Check area of gym and if its ex-raid).
* Push notifications (probably only android and computer due to iOS do not support this at this time).
* Support for different languages.
